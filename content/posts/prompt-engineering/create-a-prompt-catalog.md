# Setting Up a Prompt Catalog on GitHub for OpenAI Assistant Requests

A **Prompt Catalog** on GitHub allows you to centrally manage and version-control prompts for use with the OpenAI Assistant API. This guide walks through setting up a structured catalog in a GitHub repository.

---

## Benefits of a GitHub-Hosted Prompt Catalog

- **Centralized Management**: Keep all prompts in one repository.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to prompts over time.
- **Collaboration**: Easily share and collaborate on prompts with team members.
- **Automation**: Enable dynamic retrieval of prompts in applications or workflows.

---

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Create a new repository** on GitHub:
    - Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    - Click **New Repository** and name it (e.g., `openai-prompt-catalog`).

2. **Organize the repository**:
    - Structure the repository into directories:
      ```
      openai-prompt-catalog/
      ├── prompts/
      │   ├── general/
      │   │   └── welcome_message.json
      │   ├── technical/
      │   │   └── code_explanation.json
      │   └── creative/
      │       └── story_idea.json
      └── README.md
      ```

---

## Step 2: Define Prompt Structure

Standardize your prompt format to ensure consistency and ease of use. Use JSON or YAML for structured data.

### Example JSON Prompt File

`prompts/general/welcome_message.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "welcome_message",
  "description": "Generate a friendly welcome message for new users.",
  "content": "Create a warm and professional welcome message for a new user visiting our platform for the first time."
}
```
Example YAML Prompt File
prompts/technical/code_explanation.yaml:

yaml
Copy code
name: code_explanation
description: "Explain the functionality of a code snippet in simple terms."
content: "Explain the following Python code snippet in simple terms: {code}"
Step 3: Add a README File
Provide clear documentation for your catalog in the README.md file.

Sample README Content
markdown
Copy code
# OpenAI Prompt Catalog
